#I Will#

I Will is a project that monitors twitter for people using the string "I Will" and then, through the means of databending techniques, clashes the user's image with what he or she said.

This project was developed in PHP, using <a href="http://www.recyclism.com">Benjamin Gaulon's</a> <a href="http://www.corrupt.recyclism.com/">CorruptÂ©</a> project's code as a base for most of what it does. I cannot thank Benjamin enough for open sourcing his code.
